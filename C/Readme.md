C++ is a general-purpose object-oriented programming (OOP) language, developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, and is an extension of the C language. It is therefore possible to code C++ in a "C style" or "object-oriented style." In certain scenarios, it can be coded in either way and is thus an effective example of a hybrid language. This repository consists of the various C++ Programs and Code Snippets that have been coded in C++ Programming Language. The following programs has been implemented in the C Programming Language:
